Rally To Do:

bugs:

- sometimes takes more than 5 seconds for location to update
- no blue banner when app is using location from background

enhancements:

- map view button that centers the map over the user's location (eg. crosshair button on google maps)
- directions to markers
- rather than use defaults to determine if a user's been created already, unconditionally hit the server with the phone's UDID & return the corresponding user if there is one / create & return a new one if there isn't
- more dynamic colors for markers
- hash/encrypt UDID before sending to DB
- hit index_no_id when downloading all users so UDID's aren't downloaded
- include colored marker image at left side of tags table view cells
- retina assets for web view; mobile browsing of web view

new features:

- meta-tags: category tags for your tags so someone looking for eg. protests doesn't have to see other stuff
- chat w. voting
- twitter integration - post yr location/tag name, search twitter for tag name
